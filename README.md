## Vegetarian Eats in Little Saigon
The Tenderloin is secretly awesome for food. It's cheap, delicious, and restaraunts are somehow invariably empty, so service is snappy. Here are places that are clusted within a 3-block radius around my apartment.

### Vietnamese
Fact: anything on a menu that end with "chay" denotes vegetables.
* [Pho 2000](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-2000-san-francisco)- Pho chay with rainbow drink. You're welcome. They also do some more standard noodle stirfry dishes if you just need something greasy and salty.
* [Lee's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lees-sandwiches-san-francisco) - The superior vietnamese sandwich establishment IMO. A tofu sandwich is $3.25 with tax, and can be procured until they close at 9. The mung bean milk in the cooler is also delightful. They don't pay for advertising on yelp, which is probably why their rating is so low. Don't believe the lies, this place is the tits.
* [Saigon Sandwich](http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-sandwich-san-francisco) - The much busier and more reknown of the vietnamese sandwich establishments. Tofu sandwiches are $3.50, and they come with a bunch of mayo and sauce, and less veggies than Lee's. Also, the tour buses that roll through Larkin street always give them a shoutout, so this place is usually packed with tourists. 
* [Hiep-Thanh Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hiep-thanh-market-san-francisco) - Not a restaurant, but *the* destination to get supplies should you decide to experiment with reproducing these local delicacies in your own kitchen. They stock hard-to-find ingredients like fresh lemongrass, galangal and dragon fruit, and well as pre-made, frozen veggie rolls and more pastes and sauces than you can shake a stick at.

### Indian
* [Mela](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mela-tandoori-kitchen-san-francisco-2) - Fresh, spicy and delicious. The service can be a bit sluggish, but the food is well-worth your wait.

### Thai
Fuck Lers Ros.
* [Thai Idea](http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-idea-vegetarian-san-francisco-2) - This is my favorite restaurant right now. The menu looks like a normal thai menu, but all of the meats are soy-based (though incredibly realistic!), and most-to-all of the dished can be made vegan. Prices are reasonable for the quality and portion sizes, and the service is incredibly quick with the appropriate level of attentiveness. This is also a great takeout option. My staples here are the lamb curry, the pumpkin curry, and pad see ew.

### Sandwiches
I guess one could concievably want a non-vietnamese sandwich. Meh.
* [Morty's Deli](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mortys-delicatessen-san-francisco) - Many, very good veggie sandwiches, but on a kind of a cutty block.
* [Soul Groove](http://www.yelp.com/biz/soul-groove-san-francisco) - The turntable is good, but weird hours make it hard to give this place your money.

### Other
There is a smattering of greek, mexican, and late-nite/24 hour places in the TL. The reality is, you would be making a mistake to patronize any non-asian establishments whilst in the TL, unless literally nothing else was open, in which case...
* [Gateway Crossaint](http://www.yelp.com/biz/gateway-croissant-san-francisco-2) - your bagel and schmear one-stop-shop at 4 am. Nuff said.
